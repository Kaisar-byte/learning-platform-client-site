				Terms and Conditions Specific to E-Commerce If you operate an e-commerce
				website, you need to include rules of conduct between your website and
				your customers that apply when someone makes a purchase. This protects
				you and your business should, for example, a product purchased off your
				website fail. For an added layer of protection, consider adding an
				â€œactive agreement" to your website. An active agreement makes acceptance
				of the terms and conditions of the website a condition of sale either
				before a customer enters the site or at the point of purchase.
				E-commerce website terms and conditions contain the same information as
				regular terms and conditions, with some additions: A data protection
				statement disclosing how the customer's personal information will be
				used, stored, and protected A disclaimer of liability specifying that
				you are not responsible for any damage, expense, liability, loss, or
				personal injury Payment terms setting out how and when payment is to be
				made Delivery terms covering both shipping and delivery, including any
				related costs Product information and warranties setting out how
				products can be purchased and by whom (in the case your site has age
				restrictions, for example) and what happens if the product is out of
				stock A statement spelling out your policy on refunds and returns A
				right-to-cancel statement defining under what circumstances the customer
				can cancel an order
